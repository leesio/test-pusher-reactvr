# test-pusher-reactvr

1. `npm install` to download dependencies
2. `npm start` to start the development server
3. Go to `http://localhost:8081/vr/` preferably with [Firefox Nightly for Windows](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/), but the latest Chrome will do just for testing.
4. `index.vr.js` is the file that contains the code.
